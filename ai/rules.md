Tippd helps restaurants calculate and distribute tips fairly and consistently.
Managers enter shift sales and tips, apply their house rules, review the results, and approve them. Staff can log in to see exactly how their tips were calculated. Every shift is stored with a clear audit trail.

Tippd doesn’t move money or run payroll — it makes the math clear, defensible, and trusted.
