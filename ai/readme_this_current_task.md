# Task Context: Manager Dashboard Redesign

## Read First
- rules.md
- current_task.md
- scriptReferences.md


## File Scope
Claude should internally determine and respect:
- Primary files (directly modified)
- Reference files (logic reused, not rewritten)
- Supporting files (read-only unless strictly necessary)

Claude should update this section if the file scope changes.

## Notes
- The Manager Dashboard should become the primary daily workflow screen.
- Reuse existing Entries logic wherever possible.
- Do not change payout or compute logic.
- Existing Entries page logic is the reference implementation.
