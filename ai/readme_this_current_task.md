# Task Context: Manager Dashboard Redesign

## Read First
- rules.md
- current_task.md
- scriptReferences.md

## File Scope
Agent should internally determine and respect:
- Primary files (directly modified)
- Reference files (logic reused, not rewritten)
- Supporting files (read-only unless strictly necessary)

## Notes
## Product Context
Tippd is a manager-facing tip transparency and payout tool for restaurants.
Managers use it daily to enter sales/tips for a service period and compute payouts
for front-of-house and kitchen staff.
