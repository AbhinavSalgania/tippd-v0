ROLE

The website design new is how i want the website to look like now.

Do NOT invent new sections or features.
Rewrite copy only — not structure, not design.

CONTEXT
Product name: Tippd

Tippd is a web application for restaurants that calculates, verifies, and transparently explains tip distribution.

Important boundaries (must be respected):
- Tippd does NOT move money
- Tippd does NOT run payroll
- Tippd does NOT provide earned wage access
- Tippd does NOT replace POS systems

What Tippd DOES do:
- Acts as the system of record for tip calculation and distribution
- Allows managers to manually enter shift sales and tips (manual entry works today)
- Applies the restaurant’s existing tip-out rules consistently
- Requires manager review and approval before staff sees results
- Allows staff to log in and view their earned tips and breakdowns
- Stores a permanent audit trail for every shift

POS integrations (Toast, Square, Clover) and payout integrations are future roadmap items.
They should be mentioned only as optional or “coming later,” never as required.

AUDIENCE
Primary buyer: restaurant managers and operators  
Secondary user: servers, bartenders, kitchen staff

GOAL
Rewrite the copy across the entire website shown in the screenshots so that it:

- Is honest and precise about what Tippd does TODAY
- Builds trust for a PRE-LAUNCH product
- Reduces perceived risk and over-promising
- Positions Tippd as the “single source of truth for tips”
- Emphasizes trust, transparency, and consistency
- Leaves room to evolve into a “Financial Operating System for tips” over time WITHOUT claiming that today

LANGUAGE RULES
- Use “system of record”, “source of truth”, “tip distribution”
- Avoid “earned wages”, “payroll”, “we pay employees”, or “instant pay”
- Avoid hype, buzzwords, or aggressive growth claims


PRE-LAUNCH CONSIDERATIONS (CRITICAL)
Because this product is pre-launch:
- Avoid absolute claims unless clearly framed
- Avoid hard performance guarantees
- Emphasize manual entry working today
- Emphasize manager control and review
- Make it clear that nothing happens automatically without verification
- Reduce fear around adoption, setup, and risk

WHAT TO DELIVER
Using the screenshots as reference, rewrite the copy for:

1. Hero section
2. Problem framing sections
3. “How It Works” section
4. Staff transparency / trust sections
5. Dashboard / workflow explanation sections
6. Integrations messaging
7. FAQ section
8. Final CTA section

OUTPUT FORMAT
