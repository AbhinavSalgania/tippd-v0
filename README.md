This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Dev Script: publish:all

This repo includes a dev-only script to republish derived payout tables for all service periods. It has strict safety gates and is safe to delete when no longer needed.

Safety gates:
- Refuses to run when `NODE_ENV=production`.
- Refuses to run unless Supabase URL is local (`http://localhost:*` or `http://127.0.0.1:*`).
- Requires explicit `--yes` flag for writes.
- Supports `--dry-run` for read-only previews.

Usage:
```bash
supabase db reset
npm run publish:all -- --dry-run
npm run publish:all -- --yes
```
